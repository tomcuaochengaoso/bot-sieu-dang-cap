## Trigger Condition

Fired when a `message_edited` event occurs inside a thread whose parent
channel is of type `forum`, and the parent category is a tracked forum category.

---

## Collection Logic

**GenericChannelProcessor (forum)** resolves the pattern
`"Sửa tin nhắn về bài viết trong {channel_name}"` where `channel_name`
is replaced with the parent forum channel name (not the thread name).
The system detects forum routing by checking `parent_channel_type` contains
"forum". Category tracking via `TrackedForumCategories` determines which
forum categories are active without requiring per-channel configuration.

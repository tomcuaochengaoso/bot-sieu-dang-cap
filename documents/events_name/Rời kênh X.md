## Trigger Condition

Fired when a `user_left_voice_channel` event occurs for any voice channel.

## Collection Logic

**GenericChannelProcessor** resolves the pattern `"Rời kênh {channel_name}"`.
`TrackedVoiceCategories` checks the channel's `category_id`:
- Category `1087553008033644604` → fixed voice, luong = "Vào các kênh voice cố định"
- All other categories → custom voice, luong = "Vào các kênh voice tự tạo"

All voice channels generate leave events regardless of category — the
distinction is only in the luong assignment.
